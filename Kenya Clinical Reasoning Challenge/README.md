# Kenya Clinical Reasoning Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the "Kenya Clinical Reasoning Challenge" project, where we develop AI models to replicate clinical decision-making in rural Kenyan healthcare. This project is motivated by the need to build large language models (LLMs) that can predict clinicians' responses to authentic clinical prompts, simulating the complex decisions nurses in Kenya face daily.

## Project Background

In rural Kenya, clinicians often handle intricate medical scenarios with limited resources. This challenge provides 400 authentic clinical prompts—each a vignette combining a nurse's background and a complex medical situation—to train models that mimic real-world clinical reasoning. The goal is to create AI that can match the expertise of healthcare workers in these settings, addressing gaps in healthcare delivery.

## Objective

The primary objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model, particularly an LLM, capable of generating responses to clinical prompts that align with those of real clinicians. This can contribute to better decision support in rural healthcare and inform AI-driven policies for medical assistance.

## Importance of the Project

- **Supporting Rural Healthcare:** AI models can assist clinicians in resource-constrained environments, potentially improving patient care and outcomes in remote areas.
- **Advancing Medical AI:** By mimicking clinical reasoning, the project pushes forward innovations in AI for healthcare, focusing on real-world applicability in developing regions.
- **Educational and Skill-Building:** Integrated with courses from data.org, it helps build data science skills for AI in healthcare challenges.

## Challenge Details

- **Task:** Develop an LLM to predict and generate the clinician's response based on given clinical prompts.
