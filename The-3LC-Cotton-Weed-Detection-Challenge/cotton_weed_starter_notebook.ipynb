    "\n",
    "### 🌿 The Three Target Weeds:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class 0: Carpetweed (*Mollugo verticillata*)**\n",
    "- Mat-forming low-growing weed\n",
    "- Small, spoon-shaped leaves arranged in whorls\n",
    "- Forms dense ground cover competing with cotton seedlings\n",
    "- Light green color, spreads horizontally\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class 1: Morning Glory (*Ipomoea* species)**\n",
    "- Climbing/twining vine that wraps around cotton plants\n",
    "- Heart-shaped or lobed leaves\n",
    "- Major yield impact - strangles cotton plants\n",
    "- Can have purple, white, or pink flowers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class 2: Palmer Amaranth (*Amaranthus palmeri*)**\n",
    "- Tall, upright, fast-growing \"super weed\"\n",
    "- Lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins\n",
    "- Herbicide-resistant strain causing major agricultural problems\n",
    "- Reddish stems, can grow several feet tall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Visual Familiarity Matters:**\n",
    "- Helps identify mislabeled samples during error analysis\n",
    "- Enables better understanding of class confusion patterns\n",
    "- Assists in recognizing missing annotations\n",

    "- Automatic quality analysis and statistics\n",

    "**Traditional Approach (Doesn't Work Here):**\n",
    "- ❌ Train bigger models → **Not allowed (hardware constraints)**\n",
    "- ❌ Ensemble multiple models → **Prohibited by rules**\n",
    "- ❌ Use Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) → **Prohibited (slows inference and violates edge device constraints)**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Analyze Data Gaps (Use 3LC Dashboard)\n",
    "Visit your 3LC Dashboard and inspect your Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look for these error patterns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A. False Negatives \n",
    "- **What it is**: Model fails to detect a weed that's actually present in the image\n",
    "- **How to identify in 3LC**: \n",
    "  - High confidence predictions with low/zero IoU (model predicts something not in ground truth)\n",
    "  - Visual inspection shows weed is present but unlabeled in training data\n",
    "- **Common causes**: \n",
    "  - **Missing labels**: Objects exist but weren't annotated during labeling (data quality issue)\n",
    "  - Insufficient training examples of that weed type or appearance\n",
    "- **Fix**: Add missing annotations to training data using Dashboard editor\n",
    "- **Learn more**: [Edit tables in Dashboard](https://docs.3lc.ai/3lc/latest/how-to/basics/edit-table.html)\n",

    "##### B. False Positives\n",
    "- **What it is**: Model predicts a weed where there isn't one\n",
    "- **How to identify in 3LC**: \n",
    "  - Predictions with low IoU to any ground truth box\n",
    "  - Visual inspection shows no weed at predicted location\n",
    "- **Common causes**: \n",
    "  - Similar-looking objects mislabeled as weeds in training data\n",
    "  - Model overfitting to spurious patterns (soil, shadows, debris)\n",
    "- **Fix**: Remove incorrect labels, add negative examples (images without weeds)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### C. Class Confusion (Wrong Class Predicted)\n",
    "- **What it is**: Model detects a weed but assigns wrong class (e.g., predicts \"carpetweed\" when it's \"morningglory\")\n",
    "- **How to identify in 3LC**: \n",
    "  - High IoU but wrong class assignment\n",
    "  - Compare predicted class vs ground truth class\n",

    "  - Inconsistent labeling in training data (same weed labeled differently)\n",
    "- **Fix**: Correct mislabeled classes, add more distinguishing examples\n",

    "- **What it is**: Model detects weed and correct class, but bounding box is inaccurate\n",
    "- **How to identify in 3LC**: \n",
    "  - Correct class but low IoU (e.g., IoU between 0.3-0.5)\n",
    "  - Bounding box too large, too small, or misaligned\n",

    "Use 3LC Dashboard workflows:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Group by error type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Visual review**\n",
    "- Compare model predictions vs ground truth side-by-side\n",
    "- Look for patterns in failures (certain lighting, weed sizes, occlusions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Edit data directly in Dashboard**\n",
    "- Add missing bounding boxes\n",
    "- Correct wrong class labels\n",

    "### Why Use Scripts?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Notebook | Scripts |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| ✅ Learn concepts | ✅ Fast iteration |\n",
    "| ✅ Visual explanations | ✅ Easy to customize |\n",
    "| ✅ Step-by-step guide | ✅ No cell dependencies |\n",
    "| ✅ Interactive exploration | ✅ One command runs all |\n",
    "|  Slower (run cells) |  Faster workflow |\n",
    "\n",
    "**You've learned the \"why\" in this notebook. Now use the scripts for the \"how\" in your iterations!**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train baseline** (you just did this in the notebook!)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Switch to scripts** for faster iteration:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Edit train.py configuration, then:\n",
    "   python train.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate predictions:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Edit predict.py configuration if needed, then:\n",
    "   python predict.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze in Dashboard:**\n",
    "   - Open your run in 3LC Dashboard\n",
    "   - Identify data issues (missing labels, mislabels, etc.)\n",
    "   - Edit the table directly in Dashboard\n",
    "   - Copy the edited table URL\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retrain with fixed data:**\n",
    "   - Paste the edited table URL into `train.py`\n",
    "   - Change RUN_NAME to track the iteration (e.g., \"v3_fixed_labels\")\n",
    "   - Run `python train.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Submit and iterate!**\n",
    "   - Update MODEL_WEIGHTS in `predict.py` to your latest model\n",
    "   - Run `python predict.py`\n",
    "   - Upload `submission.csv` to Kaggle\n",
    "\n",

    "### Script Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Both scripts include:\n",
    "- ✅ **Clear configuration section** - all settings in one place at the top\n",
    "- ✅ **Helpful comments** - explains what each setting does\n",
    "- ✅ **Auto-validation** - checks for missing files and invalid settings\n",
    "- ✅ **Progress tracking** - clear output showing what's happening\n",
    "- ✅ **Error messages** - tells you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it\n",
    "- ✅ **Easy to customize** - modify the pipeline code if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn More\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Script source code**: Both scripts are well-commented - read them to understand implementation details\n",
    "- **README.md**: Complete documentation with more examples\n",
    "- **3LC Dashboard workflow**: The scripts integrate seamlessly with Dashboard editing\n",

    "**🎯 Bottom Line:** The notebook taught you the concepts. The scripts help you iterate faster with less friction!\n",

    "**Ready to iterate? Open `train.py`, make your edits, and run!** 🌾\n"
